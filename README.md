### Project overview 
-----
This project involves analyzing pizza sales data to uncover insights that can guide business decisions and performance evaluation. The goal is to build an interactive dashboard that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, order value, and sales volume. The analysis focuses on identifying sales trends, customer behavior, and operational metrics to support data-driven strategy in the food service business.


### Problem Statement 
------
  #### KPI's Requirement 
-----

We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business
performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:

1. Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.
5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

### Data Sources 
-------
### Tools 
-------
 - Excel for data cleaning
 - Microsoft SQL for data analysis 
 - Power BI - visualization 

-----
### Data Cleaning/Preparation 
-----
1. Data inspection
2. Standardizing formats on the pizza column size replace L with Large, M for Medium an S for Rgular and XLarge to X Large
3. Removing duplicates
-----
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Questions
1. Sales Trends
  - How does total revenue vary by day, week, or month?
  - Are there seasonal patterns or peak periods in pizza sales?

2. Product Performance
  - Which pizza types or categories generate the most revenue?
  - Which pizzas are ordered most frequently?

3. Customer Behavior

  - What is the distribution of order values?
  - How many pizzas do customers typically order per transaction?

4. Time-Based Insights

  - What times of day or days of the week have the highest order volumes?
  - Are there specific time slots that generate more revenue?

5. Order Composition

  - What is the average number of items per order?
  - Are certain pizza sizes or types often ordered together?

6. Revenue Drivers
  - Is higher revenue driven more by quantity or high-priced items?
  - Are larger orders associated with specific customer segments or time frames?

7. Operational Questions
  - Are there differences in performance across different locations (if applicable)?
  - Are there bottlenecks or outliers in the order processing or delivery data?

### Data Analysis 

-----  
Total Revenue

`SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales;`

Average Order Value 

`SELECT SUM(total_price)/ COUNT (DISTINCT order_id) AS Average_Order_Value from pizza_sales `

Total Number of Pizzas Sold

`SELECT SUM(quantity) As Total_Pizza_Sold from pizza_sales`

Total_Orders

`SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT order_id) As Total_Orders from pizza_sales`

Average Pizzas Per Order

`SELECT CAST( CAST (SUM(quantity) AS decimal (10,2)) / 
CAST(COUNT (Distinct order_id)AS decimal (10,2))as decimal (10,2)) AS Average_Pizzas_per_order from pizza_sales`


Total oders by day of week 

`SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date)as order_day, COUNT (DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_orders
from pizza_sales 
GROUP BY DATENAME (DW, order_date)`

Total oders by month

`SELECT DATENAME(MONTH, order_date)as Month_name, COUNT (DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_orders
from pizza_sales 
GROUP BY DATENAME (MONTH, order_date)`


Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category

`SELECT pizza_category,sum(total_price) as total_sales, sum(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT sum(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS Percentage_of_sales
from pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category`

Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size

`SELECT pizza_size, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_size
ORDER  BY PCT DESC`

Total Revenue from top five types of pizza 

`SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, Sum (total_price) as Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC`

Top selling Pizza by numbers

`SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, Sum (quantity) as Total_quantity FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_quantity DESC`

## **Results/Findings** 
-----
1. üìÖ Sales Trends
Peak Days: Orders are highest on Fridays and Saturdays, particularly in the evenings.
Peak Months: July and January recorded the highest number of orders, suggesting seasonal demand spikes.

2. üçï Product Performance
Top Category: The Classic category contributes the most to both revenue and total orders.
Top Size: Large pizzas generate the highest sales, indicating a strong customer preference.
Top Pizza by Revenue: Thai Chicken pizza leads in revenue generation.
Top Pizza by Quantity & Orders: Classic Deluxe is the most frequently ordered and sold pizza.

3. üìâ Underperforming Product
Brie Carre pizza contributes the least in terms of revenue, quantity sold, and total orders.

### Recommendations
---
Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended to improve business performance:

1. üìà Boost High-Performing Products
Promote Classic Deluxe and Thai Chicken pizzas through featured menu spots or combo deals.
Consider upselling Large pizzas with bundled offers to increase average order value.

2. üìâ Address Underperforming Items
Reevaluate the Brie Carre pizza: assess its pricing, ingredients, and customer appeal.
Consider promotional campaigns or recipe adjustments to improve its performance‚Äîor remove it if it continues to underperform.

4. üïí Optimize Operations for Peak Times
Increase staffing and inventory on Fridays, Saturdays, and during July and January to meet demand.
Explore targeted promotions during off-peak days to balance order volume.

5. üìä Enhance Data Collection
Incorporate customer demographics, time-of-day data, and location information to enable deeper insights.
Track delivery times and customer feedback to improve service quality.

### Limitations
---
Limitations
Despite the valuable insights derived from the pizza sales data, several limitations should be acknowledged:

1. Lack of Customer Demographics
The dataset does not include customer-specific information such as age, gender, location, or preferences. This limits the ability to perform customer segmentation or targeted marketing analysis.

2. No Time-of-Day Granularity
While daily and monthly trends are analyzed, the absence of detailed timestamps (e.g., hour or minute) restricts insights into peak ordering hours or time-based promotions.

3. No Location Data
If the business operates multiple branches, the lack of location-specific data prevents performance comparisons across outlets or regions.

4. No Delivery or Fulfillment Metrics
Operational efficiency metrics such as delivery time, order preparation time, or customer satisfaction are not available, which limits the ability to assess service quality.

5. Static Dataset
The analysis is based on a snapshot of historical data. Without real-time or regularly updated data, the dashboard and insights may become outdated quickly.

6. Limited Product Metadata
There is no information on ingredient costs, preparation time, or profit margins, which could enhance profitability analysis and menu optimization.

7. No Marketing Attribution
The dataset lacks information on promotions, discounts, or marketing campaigns, making it difficult to assess the impact of marketing efforts on sales performance.
