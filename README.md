### Project overview 

This project involves analyzing pizza sales data to uncover insights that can guide business decisions and performance evaluation. The goal is to build an interactive dashboard that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, order value, and sales volume. The analysis focuses on identifying sales trends, customer behavior, and operational metrics to support data-driven strategy in the food service business.


### Problem Statement 

  #### KPI's Requirement 

We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business
performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:

1. Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the
total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.
5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by
dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Questions
1. Sales Trends
  - How does total revenue vary by day, week, or month?
  - Are there seasonal patterns or peak periods in pizza sales?

2. Product Performance
  - Which pizza types or categories generate the most revenue?
  - Which pizzas are ordered most frequently?

3. Customer Behavior

  - What is the distribution of order values?
  - How many pizzas do customers typically order per transaction?

4. Time-Based Insights

  - What times of day or days of the week have the highest order volumes?
  - Are there specific time slots that generate more revenue?

5. Order Composition

  - What is the average number of items per order?
  - Are certain pizza sizes or types often ordered together?

6. Revenue Drivers
  - Is higher revenue driven more by quantity or high-priced items?
  - Are larger orders associated with specific customer segments or time frames?

7. Operational Questions
  - Are there differences in performance across different locations (if applicable)?
  - Are there bottlenecks or outliers in the order processing or delivery data?
